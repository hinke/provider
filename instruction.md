We're building an app for doctors to manage their patients progress in a sleep program.

The app will have the following features:

1. A list for doctors to see their patients
2. A dashboard representing a patient's progress in the sleep program and how their sleep is improving

The app is built with:
- Next.js with app router 
- Tailwind css 
- shadcn/ui 
- typescript
